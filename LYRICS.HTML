        <div style="background-color:burlywood ;">I searched the world
        But it couldn't fill me
        Man's empty praise
        And treasures that fade
        Are never enough
        Then You came along
        And put me back together
        And every desire
        Is now satisfied
        Here in Your love (hey)
    
        Oh, there's nothing better than You
        There's nothing better than You
        Lord, there's nothing
        Nothing is better than You (oh)
        (Yes, I know it's true)
        (Come on, tell Him, hey)

        I'm not afraid
        To show You my weakness
        My failures and flaws
        Lord, You've seen them all
        And You still call me friend
        'Cause the God of the mountain
        Is the God of the valley
        There's not a place
        Your mercy and grace
        Won't find me again (come on, now)

        Oh, there's nothing better than You
        There's nothing better than You
        Lord, there's nothing
        Nothing is better than You
        (I know it's true)
        Oh, there's nothing better than You (somebody testify)
        There's nothing better than You
        Lord, there's nothing
        Nothing is better than You
        (If He's ever made a way for you, I want you to sing this)
        (Come on, tear the roof off)

        You turn mourning to dancing
        You give beauty for ashes
        You turn shame into glory
        You're the only one who can (come on)
        You turn mourning to dancing
        You give beauty for ashes
        You turn shame into glory (tell 'em now)
        You're the only one who can (let's turn the graves)
        You turn graves into gardens
        You turn bones into armies
        You turn seas into highways
        You're the only one who can (he's the only one)
        You're the only one who can

        Oh, there's nothing (come on, choir), better than You
        Oh, there's nothing better than You
        Lord, there's nothing
        Nothing is better than You (I've searched and not found)
        Oh, there's nothing better than You
        There's nothing better than You
        Lord, there's nothing
        Nothing is better than You
    </div>
       <div style="background-color:lightblue;">Oh, come on, if He turned your grave into a garden, say)
        You turn graves into gardens
        You turn bones into armies
        You turn seas into highways
        You're the only one who can (turning graves)
        You turn graves into gardens (He's turning bones into an army)
        You turn bones into armies (He's makin' waves through the seas)
        You turn seas into highways
        You're the only one who can
        You're the only one who can
        You're the only one who can

        Somebody give Him praise in this house
        I don't think we're finished yet, come on
        I think He's turning some things over tonight
        You turn my mourning into dancing, come on
        You turn mourning to dancing (yeah)
        You give beauty for ashes (shame into glory)
        You turn shame into glory
        You're the only one who can (oh, He's turnin' my grave)

        You turn graves into gardens
        You turn bones into armies (He's makin' waves through the seas)
        You turn seas into highways (You're the only)
        You're the only one who can (come on, one more time)
        (You turn my grave into a garden)

        You turn graves into gardens (You're resurrectin' bones)
        You turn bones into armies (You're makin' waves through my sea)
        You turn seas into highways (shout it out, You're the only)
        You're the only one who can (You're the only)
        You're the only one who can (You're the only)
        You're the only one who can
        Jesus, You're the only one
        Come on, give Him one more shout of praise</div> (</pre>
